# API Documentation: DikeShield Processing Gateway

The DikeShield Processing Gateway API allows websites to process payment transactions using the DikeShield service. This document outlines the data format for communication between the website and the DikeShield gateway.

## Authorization

The unique identifier (API key) of the website will be provided by DikeShield during registration.

Each request must include the `api-key` header containing your API key.

Each API key has a whitelist of allowed domains and IPs. Before the integration you must provide the following information to administrator's email along with the website name:

1. A list of domains of the `redirect_url` (up to 3 domains).
2. A list of domains of the `callback_url` (up to 3 domains).
3. A list of IPs of the servers that will make API requests (up to 3 IPs).

## General Information

Endpoint: `https://api.dshield.co/v3/`

Response body example for a successful request:

```
{
    "result": "success",
    "data": ...
}
```

Response body example for a failed request:

```
{
    "result": "error",
    "message": "Error description text."
}
```

If you use something other than PHP on the backend, when making a request to the API, specify the following header:

```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

## Create a payment link

`POST https://api.dshield.co/v3/payment`
